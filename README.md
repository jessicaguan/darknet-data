This project explores data scraped from dark web marketplaces (three former popular marketplaces, Dream Market, Agora, and Valhalla) by using data-driven methods. The data was found through the [Darknet Archives](https://gwern.net/dnm-archive). The datasets were too large to upload to GitHub.

Code can be found in `DarkNetData.ipynb` file. Full project report can be found in the file `Exploring_DarkWeb_Marketplaces.pdf`.
